# incivlity-in-the-wild

This project targets to identify incivilities in comments posted by users in social media. We trained our models on the AZ Daily Star comments collected by the department of Communications, University of Arizona. The models used in this project have their base in the Kaggle task to detect toxicity in Wikipedia comments (https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/). 

We also use our trained models to detect uncivil comments from a set of previously unannotated tweets (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets).
